# manageMePy
## A command line budgeting tool
userScript.py and Items.py are the two main files I am currently working with. Finding proper
data structures to store Object Oriented Data and cleaning up the code are two of my current priorities.

I mainly worked on this project over summer on my free time in hopes that it would help me track my
spending in college.

So far I was able to get user input, then convert the user input into object oriented structures in Python,
then get the data from the object oriented functions and input the data into an excel sheet using Pandas,
and DataFrame.

As of right now, the project works. However, like I have mentioned before I want to
* Increase modularity
* Use more effective data structures
* Implement a pdf command that includes more info about an individuals spending
* Use less redundant code
